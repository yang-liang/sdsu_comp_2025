# Replicating Angrist and Evans (1996) Using ACS Data

## Overview
This page is designed for SDSU Economics graduate students preparing for their comprehensive exams. The goal is to use the American Community Survey (ACS) data from IPUMS to replicate the findings of Angrist and Evans (1996) on the impact of exogenous variation in family size on parental labor supply. 

## Data Source
The raw data for this project is available via the following Google Drive link:

[ACS Data (raw and clean)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WwI31_8Ap-ltO0hyC3HnM0MJrZqSTTXw?usp=sharing)

Data is sourced from IPUMS USA, ensuring consistency with previous research and enabling a reliable replication exercise.

## Instructions
1. Download the raw ACS data from the provided Google Drive link.
2. Clean and organize the dataset. (I've provided some [code](1_data_prep.do) that cleans and structures ACS data from 2010–2015, making it suitable for replication—if we think cleaning and doing the analysis is too much for the given timeframe. The framework is flexible and can be easily extended, so feel free to modify as needed.)
3. Perform the replication analysis following the instructions.
